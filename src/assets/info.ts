  "Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ My name, if you couldn't tell from the header, is Ian Cowan. I am a software engineer and part time flight instructor and love learning new things in both the computer science and aviation world. One of my favorite areas in programming is server administration and if you couldn't guess, yes, I use the command line for everything (even my editor - yes I use NeoVim). I began flying in 2017 and have since obtained my commercial ASEL certificate along with my CFI-I certificates. Flying and programming are two of my passions, and I love to work with projects that combine these two together.<br/><br />Please have fun exploring my bare bones CLI website and finding some of the easter eggs I have hidden. You can also find this project on GitHub, but finding the easter eggs that way is just cheating!";
